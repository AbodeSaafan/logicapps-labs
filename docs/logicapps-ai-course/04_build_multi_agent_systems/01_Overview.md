# Overview

> Note: This should have a note indicating that the concepts in the conversational agent and autonomous labs are prerequisites for this lab.


- Logic Apps supports different orchestration patterns: handoff, nested agents as tools, sequential agents
- Multi-agent system: Handoff
    - Why to do it
  - How to do it
  - How to describe handoffs
  - What to add to system prompt if useful
  - Having initialization action to set state before the handoff agent and why
  - Run & monitoring view nuances
- Multi-agent system: Nested agents as tools
  - Why to do it
  - Introduction to Haripriyas action
  - Regular nested workflow action(?)
  - Example of conversational -> conversational nested agent
  - Example of autonomous -> conversational nested agent
- Multi-agent system: Sequential orchestration
  - Stateful workflow with multiple agents one after the other
  - Other actions in between

This has not been fleshed out enough, but should follow the same format of the conversational chat (e.g. break down in multiple modules if required)
