# Module 04 - Add parameters to your tools

In previous modules, we discussed how to add tools to your agent. Sometimes a tool can vary its behavior based on some input argument - we call these parameters. For example, a GetWeather tool can be configured to always look up the weather in Seattle. But if the location should be dynamic, then we need to add a location parameter to the tool.

In this module, we explore different ways you can parameterize your tool calls. We discuss how to:
- add parameters & annotate them for the LLM
- use the monitoring view to trace how parameters are generated & flow through tool actions
- configure whether a parameter should be static (like the Seattle example above), dynamically generated by an LLM, or a mix of both

Together, these capabilities offer granular control & clear observability into how your agent uses parameters.

## Adding parameters to a tool

Let's begin with an agent without any parameters. Here is a simple agent that knows how to get the weather in Seattle. The screenshots below show its system prompt, tools, and sample interaction:

This agent can only determine weather in Seattle because the "Location" field in "Get current weather" action is always set to Seattle. Even if the user requests data about a different city, the platform does not allow the agent to 

Parameterizing tools (both LLM-generated & static)

- Amend or create scenario where agent parameter is required
- How to add it in designer
- Importance of agent parameter metadata (param name, param description)
- LA offers granular control via different options:  action param fully from LLM, action param static, and action param mixed of both static & LLM-based content
- How to identify agent parameters in MonView so user can see what LLM provided.
