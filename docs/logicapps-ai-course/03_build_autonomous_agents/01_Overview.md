# Overview

> Note: This should have a note indicating that the concepts in the conversational agent lab are prerequisites for this lab.

- When is autonomous agent useful vs conversational one
- How to create autonomous agent
- How to trigger from different external events
- Option to have foundry backend
- Running it and showing similar monitoring
- Request response with last assistant message token (?)

This has not been fleshed out enough, but should follow the same format of the conversational chat (e.g. break down in multiple modules if required)
